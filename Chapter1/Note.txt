1) C++ can be consider as a combination of four sublanguages:

+ C: way down deep, C++ is still based on C.
+ Object-Oriented C++: This part of C++ is what C with Classes was all about: classes (including constructors and destructors), encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, virtual functions, etc.
+ Template C++: This is the generic programming part of C++, the one that most programmers have the least experience with.
+ STL: The STL is a template library, of course, but it's a very special template library. Its conventions regarding containers, iterators, algorithms, and function objects mesh beautifully.

2) Prefer consts, enums, and inlines to #defines

This might better be called "prefer the compiler to the preprocessor", because #define may be treated as if it's not part of the language. When you do something like this.

#define ASPECT_RATIO 1.653

the symbolic name ASPECT_RATIO may never seen by compiler; it may be removed by the preprocessor before the source code ever gets to a compiler. This can be confusing if you get an error during compilation involving the use of the constant, because the error message may refer to 1.653 instead of ASPECT_RATIO.

The solution is to replace the macro with a constant:

const double AspectRatio = 1.653;

To define a constant char*-based string in a header file, for example, you have to write const twice:

const char * const authorName = "Scott Meyers";

String objects are generally preferable to their char*-based

const std::string authorName("Scott Meyers");

For class specific constants. To limit the scope of a constant to a class, you must make it a member, and to ensure there's most one copy ot the constant, you must make it a static member:

class GamePlayer {
  static const int NumTurns = 5;   // constant declaration
  int scores[NumTurns];            // Use of constant
  ...
};

Older compiler may not accept the above declaration.

const int GamePlayer::Numturns; // Definition of NumTurns doesn't have any value.

For older compiler, it should be:

class CostEstimate {
private:
  static const double FudgeFactor;
  ....
};

const double
  CostEstimate::FudgeFactor = 1.35;

This is all you need almost all the time. The only exception is when you need the value of a class constant during compilation of the class such as in the case of GamePlayer class above.

class GamePlayer {
private:
  enum { NumTurns = 5};

  int scores[NumTurns];
  ...
};

This is called enum hack. If you don't want to let people get a pointer or reference to one of your integral constants, an enum is a good way to enforce that constraint. 

#define CALL_WITH_MAX(a,b) f((a) > (b) ? (a):(b))

Macros like this have so many drawbacks, just thinking about them is painful.

Whenever you write this kind of macro, you have to remember to parenthesize all the arguments in the macro body. Otherwise you can run into trouble when somebody calls the macro with an expression. But even if you get that right, look at the weird things that can happen:

int a = 5, b = 0;
CALL_WITH_MAX(++a,b);       // a is incremented twice.
CALL_WITH_MAX(++a,b+10);    // a is incrementeed once. 

Here, the number of times that a is incremented before calling f depends on what it is being compared with!

Fortunately, you don't need to put up with this nonsense. You can get all the efficiency of a macro plus all the predictable behavior and type safety of a regular function by using a template for an inline function.

template<typename T>
inline void callWithMax(const T& a, const T& b)
{
  f(a>b ? a:b); 
}

Thing to remember
+ For simple constants, prefer const objects or enums to #defines.
+ For function-like macros, prefer inline functions to #defines.

-> Prefer compiler to preprocessor.

3) Use const whenever possible.
The wonderful thing about const is that it allows you to specify a semantic constraint -- a particular object should not be modified -- and compilers will enforce that constraint. It allows you to commmunicate to both compilers and other programmers that a value should remain invariant.

char greeting[]="Hello";
char * p = greeting; // non-const pointer, non-const data
const char *p = greeting; //non-const pointer, const data
char* const p = greeting; //const pointer, non-const data
const char * const p = greeting; // const pointer, const data

void f1(const Widget *pw);    //f1 takes a pointer to a const Widget object.
void f2(Widget const *pw);    //so does f2
void f3(Widget * const pw);   //f1 takes a constant pointer.

STL iterators are modeled on pointers, so an iterator acts much like a T* pointer. Declaring an iterator const is like declaring a pointer const.

std::vector<int> vec;
...

const std::vector<int>::iterator iter = vec.begin();  // iter acts like a T* const
*iter = 10;            // OK, changes what iter points to
++iter;                // error! iter is const.

std::vector<int>::const_iterator citer = vec.begin();  // iter acts like a const T*
*citer = 10;           // Error! *citer is const
++citer;               // fine, change citer;

Having a function return a constant value is generally inappropriate, but sometimes doing so can reduce the incidence of client erros without giving up safety or efficiency.

class Rational{...};
const Rational operator*(const Rational& lhs, const Rational& rhs);

Why should the result of operator* be a const object? Because if it weren't, clients would be able to commit atrocities like this:

Rational a, b, c;
...
(a*b)=c;          // invoke operator= on the result of a*b!!!!!

All it takes is a simple typo (and a type that can be implicitly converted to bool):

if(a*b=c)...

const Member Functions

The purpose of const on member functions it so identify which member function may be invoked on const objects. Such member functions are important for two reasons. First, they make the interface of a class easier to understand. It's important to know which functions may modify an object and which may not. Second, they make it possible to work with const objects. One of the fundamental ways to improve a C++ program's performance is to pass objects by reference-to-const.

class TextBlock {
public:
 ...
 const char& operator[](std:size_t position) const       //operator[] for
 {return text[position];}                                //const objects.
 char& operator[](std:size_t position)                   //operator[] for
 {return text[position];}                                //non-const objects
private:
 std:string text;
};

TextBlock's operator[]s can be used like this:
TextBlock tb("Hello"); 
std::cout << tb[0];                // calls non-const
                                   // TextBlock::operator[]

const TextBlock ctb("World");
std:cout << ctb[0];                // calls const TextBlock::operator[]
